# Gym Trainer using AI :
IN this project we will build a gym trianor model which will detect the accuracy of your pose when you are doing curls 
# Technology used :
we have used opencv for visualisiation and machine learning for training 
# How it works :
The working is based on angle detection beteween three points 
we set criteria for every angle and according to the angle we get we sets accuracy that at what angle the pose is less accurate and at what angle the pose is more accurate.
